# OS Codes

This repository contains a collection of Operating System (OS) lab programs and simulations written in **C**, developed during academic coursework. These programs focus on core OS concepts such as **process synchronization**, **multithreading**, **pipes**, **inter-process communication**, and **resource sharing**.
